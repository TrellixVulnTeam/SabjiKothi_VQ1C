            <p>
              Saptkrishi is an IIT-Kanpur-incubated startup which has developed
              a cost-effective way of extending the life of the perishable
              produce, using cold storage that farmers or vegetable vendors can
              set up effortlessly anywhere and save their products from going
              bad. The product is called SaptKrishi Sabjikothi which is
              essentially a micro climate storage for fruits and vegetables that
              is also portable enough to be mounted on hand carts, trucks,
              e-rickshaws etc. As per data from our surveys, 92% of marginal
              farmers generate income for their daily household expenses through
              selling fruits and vegetables. After harvesting them, a farmer
              takes her produce to the local mandi, which on average lies 14-15
              km away. To cover this journey, it would take around a couple of
              hours. For these few hours, the produce is exposed to a harsh
              tropical outer environment wherein they lose a lot of water. By
              the end of two hours, the weight of the produce may fall from 100
              kg to anywhere about 96 kg.

            <p>
              Preservator/ Sabjikothi is a low- cost, technological solution
              that extends the shelf life of perishable horticultural produce
              through the construction of a high-humid near- sterile, ethylene
              oxidizing micro- climate in an isolated chamber that extends the
              shelf-life of horticulture produces and also helpful in cutting
              the chain of COVID transmission.

            <p>
              Preservator/Sabjikothi is a wheel mountable storage for
              transportation of fresh fruits and vegetables. It is a
              microclimate portable storage that extend the shelf-life of fruits
              and vegetables anywhere between 5 to 30 days. The entire setup can
              be unloaded from wheels, and can doubly acts as on-field & on-
              market storage.

              <h2>Oxidising Ethylene</h2>
              <p>
                Sabjikothi makes use of ethylene oxidising and near-sterile
                microclimate in an insulated chamber that inhibits pathogen
                growth, delays ripening and regulates the activity of
                antioxidant enzymes. It oxidises ethylene into hydrogen, carbon
                dioxide, water vapour and other small molecules which further
                creates a controlled atmosphere that helps the produce stay
                fresh for longer.

                It requires 20 watts of power and one litre of water to help it
                keep things cool inside. It comes fitted with a battery that is
                capable of lasting for a whole day on a single charge. However,
                there is also an option of solar charging to extend the lifespan
                of the battery, slightly longer.

                stored. It’s also pretty affordable at Rs 10,000 per unit.
                There’s another variant that’s designed for traders that is
                capable of storing up to 500 kilograms of produce and also comes
                with a mobile app for monitoring the health of the produce as
