          <p>
            Saptkrishi is an IIT-Kanpur-incubated startup which has developed a cost-effective way of extending the life
            of the perishable produce, using cold storage that farmers or vegetable vendors can set up effortlessly
            anywhere and save their products from going bad. The product is called SaptKrishi Sabjikothi which is
            essentially a micro climate storage for fruits and vegetables that is also portable enough to be mounted on
            hand carts, trucks, e-rickshaws etc. As per data from our surveys, 92% of marginal farmers generate income
            for their daily household expenses through selling fruits and vegetables. After harvesting them, a farmer
            takes her produce to the local mandi, which on average lies 14-15 km away. To cover this journey, it would
            take around a couple of hours. For these few hours, the produce is exposed to a harsh tropical outer
            environment wherein they lose a lot of water. By the end of two hours, the weight of the produce may fall
            from 100 kg to anywhere about 96 kg.

          <p>
            Preservator/ Sabjikothi is a low-
            cost, technological solution that
            extends the shelf life of perishable
            horticultural produce through the
            construction of a high-humid near-
            sterile, ethylene oxidizing micro-
            climate in an isolated chamber
            that extends the shelf-life of
            horticulture produces and also
            helpful in cutting the chain of
            COVID transmission.

          <h4 class="hide-sm">Uses! <br /></h4>
          <p>
            Preservator/Sabjikothi is a wheel
            mountable storage for transportation
            of fresh fruits and vegetables.

            It is a microclimate portable storage
            that extend the shelf-life of fruits and
            vegetables anywhere between 5 to 30 days.

            The entire setup can be
            unloaded from wheels, and can
            doubly acts as on-field & on-
            market storage.

            <p>Sabjikothi makes use of ethylene oxidising and near-sterile microclimate
              in an insulated chamber that inhibits pathogen growth, delays ripening
              and regulates the activity of antioxidant enzymes. It oxidises ethylene
              into hydrogen, carbon dioxide, water vapour and other small molecules
              which further creates a controlled atmosphere that helps the produce
              stay fresh for longer.</p>

              whole day on a single charge. However, there is also an option of solar
              charging to extend the lifespan of the battery, slightly longer.</p>

              also pretty affordable at Rs 10,000 per unit.
              There’s another variant that’s designed for traders that is capable of
              storing up to 500 kilograms of produce and also comes with a mobile
              app for monitoring the health of the produce as well as other diagnostics.</p>
